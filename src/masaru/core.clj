(defn consume
  "Automaton A consumes symbol S at vertex V, disposing by D.

  A must function this way: ((A state-number) symbol) => operation,
  where the operation is a single number (the goto state) with a
  non-terminal symbol, and with a terminal symbol, the operation can
  be either a number (the shift state), or a vector (the reduction
  rule), or a set of these things (specifically, a set of any number
  of reduction rules but at most one shift state).

  S is a terminal symbol. When it is successfully consumed, the vertex
  returned represents S, and can be used as V in the next application.
  If S cannot be parsed, then an empty vertex is returned.

  V is a hash-map from state numbers to predecessor vertices or sets
  of predecessors. The starting pseudo-vertex can be {0 nil}. The
  results of reductions produced by D are stored with key :res in the
  metadata of the vertices.

  D must be a function that takes a terminal symbol, or a non-terminal
  symbol and a list of vertices. The unary case will be applied during
  shift operation, and the binary case will be applied during reduce
  operation, when the list of vertices are to be reduce to a vertex
  representing the non-terminal symbol. (With Ïµ-rules, the list is
  simply empty.) The return value should be wrapped in a collection,
  so that when ambiguities occur, the 'into function can be applied to
  these collections. (With an unambiguous grammar, no wrapping is
  required.)  When D is omitted, the result in a vertex lists the
  symbol it represents and its children nodes (if any) in the parse
  tree, which would prevent some reduced and useless vertices from
  being garbage collected."
